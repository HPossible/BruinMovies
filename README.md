This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, create a backend, we used mongodb, and put the email,password,next api url, the mongodb uri, and the jwt in a file called .env. 

Second, follow the instructions on requirements.txt to have the web scraper working. This will provide data to the website when it runs.

Then, download nextjs by using npm install next.

Then, use npm run build to bulid the project. 

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
